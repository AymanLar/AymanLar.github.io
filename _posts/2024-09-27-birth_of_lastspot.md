## Context
To give you a little context, I'm someone who loves music. I enjoy listening to it and making it, even if the outcome sometimes sucks. I enjoy the journey—from playing an unplugged electric guitar to connecting it to the soundcard, opening the DAW, adding tracks, and mixing.

But that’s not the subject of this blog. I'm here to talk about Lastspot, a web app I created to simplify the process of discovering music. Not only that, but you can also create playlists based on anyone's taste, as all music tastes are open source (thanks to Last.fm).

So, how did this idea come to mind? Basically, I wanted to convert my Last.fm playlists (library, mix, recommendations) into actual Spotify playlists for easier listening. Since I don't have Last.fm Premium, which lets you sync songs from Last.fm to Spotify, it became a pain to make playlists.

Who could solve this problem better than a hacky Python script? I made that script, but something felt off—people should be able to use this too. So, I decided to create a the web version of the script to make it convenient for everyone.

## scenarios for using Lastspot:
- **Surprising Friends**: Create playlists for your friends.it's fun
- **Know Your Friends Better**: explore your friends' music tastes. It’s a fun way to connect on a deeper level! 

the sky is the limit
HAVE FUN !
